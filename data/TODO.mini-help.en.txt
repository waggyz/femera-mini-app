-i<int> iteration report modulus
  -1 automatic (default)
   0 no iteration data
   1 every iteration
  >1 print every <int> iterations
   NOTE: small values can slow run time
-t timing data reported
   NOTE: can slow run time when used with -d if compiled with
         -DENABLE_TIMING_DETAILS
-w<int> warning level sets the warning/error level allowed to continue.
  (default is -w1).
  -1 INFO
   0 NOTE
   1 WARNING (default to continue)
   2 ERROR (default to exit with error)
3-10 (reserved)
  11 ERROR that cannot continue

Options in upper case are shortcuts to common modeling and simulation tasks.
Most of these will update the simulation database if the task is out of date.
They may be specified in any order, together or apart.

-G Generate grids.
-P Partition meshes.
-R Read simulation results from the database. This can be used for a restart.
-S Solve the problem.
-C Compare results to another in the database, or to a reference solution when
   used with -T. (-= is equivalent to -C.)
-V Visualize results.
-A All simulation phases will be checked and run if out of date, equivalent to
   -GPRSCV. This is also the default behavior if NONE of the other task
   options (-GPRSCV) are provided.

Other options in upper case modify the behavior of the simulation task options
above.

-H Help with the other simulation task options selected, then exit.
   For example, -SH summarizes how to use a -S Solver.
-I Inform without doing any work. This can be used with -d to get simulation
   details.
-F Force the command line simulation phases given to run, even if they are
   up to date in the database. (-! is equivalent to -F.)
-O Overwrite the most recent data (if present), instead of appending.
-0 0 (no) data will be saved. This is useful for comparing or visualizing
   simulation results without updating the database, and for performance
   testing.
-1 1 (only the first) file will be used to save results.
-E Erase, rather than create, the data indicated by the other upper-case
   options. For example -EGS will remove the most recent grid and solution.
-T Test predefined built-in models, if compiled with ENABLE_TESTS (the default).
   If the database specified does not exist, or the model name (-m) is not found
   in the database, the name will be checked if it is a recognized built-in test
   model or collection. Using -T without -n will attempt to run all built-in
   tests.

A dash character (-) may be used to pipe a database in.
(default is no file; models can be created and manipulated in memory)

===============================================================================

Tasks can be restricted by providing an integer parameter to an upper-case task
option. More sophisticated simulation control can be done by modifying the
database.

-G<int> Generate grid number <int> in the database.
-P<int> Partition meshes into <int> parts.
-R<int> Read solution number <int> from the file specified.
-S<int> Stop after <int> iterations.
-C<int> Compare to solution number <int> in the database.
-V<int> Visualize model number <int> in the database.
-U<int> Write solution to the file specified every <int> iterations.
-T<int> Run built-in test number <int>.


-D Provides more details about the other options selected. For example, -SD
   will show details of the simulation solver settings. [already have -d]


-q quiet mode generates a warning on stderr that it is in quiet mode,
   then suppress warnings about the use of simulation defaults.
   (The default is to emit these warnings, unless -T is also used.)
   NOTE: using -T also turns on -q.

-q0 explicitly turns off quiet mode (for use with -T).

Developer options

-b<int> bug level <int> to report when debugging
-m<int> do test number <int> when compiled with -DENABLE_UNIT_TESTS
