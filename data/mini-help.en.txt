Usage: femera [-options] [databases]

Femera command line options override simulation settings in the database.

Options in lower case do not modify a model, but can be used to get information
   and set run time parameters.

-h help by printing this, then exit.
-v version number reported, then exit.
-v<int> verbosity level, limited by compiled MAX_VERBOSITY (default 7)
   NOTE: can slow run time if > 7
   0 no information reported
   1 Femera version and compile-time options
   2 program run-time information and options
   3 simulation info
   4 load step info
   5 Newton step info, if applicable
   6 iteration info
   7 partition info (default)
   8 element info
   9 integration point info
  10 (reserved)
 >10 debugging output
-d detail level set to verbosity level
-d<int> detailed information level cannot exceed verbosity level
   NOTE: can slow simulation run time
-d detail level set to verbosity level
-t<int> timing detail level, limited by compiled MAX_TIMING_DETAIL (default 7)
   NOTE: a high level of timing detail can slow overall run time
-n number of threads to assign to each MPI process.
   The default is OMP_NUM_THREADS or the number of logical cores
-i<str> input file(s)
-o<str> output file
-m<str> model name(s)
-s<str> screen Xwindows name (e.g. :0.0)
-x<int> Repeat tasks <int> times. This is useful for performance testing.

If no (-m) models are given, Femera will run every simulation found in the
input (-i) files specified. If an output (-o) file is not provided, Femera
appends results to the first input file containing previous solutions, or to the
first file containing data for that model.

Options in upper case are shortcuts to common modeling and simulation tasks.
Most of these will update the simulation database if the task is out of date.
They may be specified in any order, together or apart.

Some options in upper case modify the behavior of the simulation task options
above.

-D Defaults will be used when data not present. This is useful for testing.
-XS -SM -MD -LG -XL assumed simulation size
-T Testing enabled
